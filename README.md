# Shopping Cart Project

## Overview

This application lets the user interact with a fake store. There are 4 pages in total: Home, Store, Cart and About. Home provides some placeholder text and serves as a showcase of CSS scroll snap. Store page fetches items from the Fake Store API and lets the user put them into the cart. The Navbar component will be updated with a new number of items currently in the cart. The Cart page lets the user see the items they have in the cart at the moment and has 2 links for either going to the checkout page if the cart is not empty, or resetting the cart. The About page links you to this repository. Made as a part of [the Odin Project course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart).
